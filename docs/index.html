    <b>Controller / Company</b><br/>
    Innovation Business Solutions LTD (Registration No. 222871)<br/>
    Suite 1, Second Floor, Sound &amp; Vision House, Francis Rachel Str., Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles<br/>
    Privacy contact (support): <b>@DexPN_Support_bot</b>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal data when you use:
    (a) the DexPN Android application (“App”) and (b) the DexPN Telegram bot(s) (“Bot”) that may be used for login,
    subscription management, and support.
  </p>

  <h2>2) What data we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the data required to operate the service and provide support:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Telegram account data (via Bot):</b> Telegram <code>chat_id</code>, username (nickname), and language (if available).
      We do not request or require your real name, home address, or date of birth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Subscription &amp; service data:</b> selected plan/tariff, subscription status and dates, issued access credentials/keys identifiers
      (only what is needed to manage access), and basic account state.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Payment data (if you pay):</b> payment method metadata necessary to confirm your payment (for example: transaction hash/txid,
      network, amount, time, and the destination wallet address used for the order). We do not store full card details.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Device &amp; app technical data (minimal):</b> app version, Android version, device model, and basic diagnostics needed to run
      the VPN and troubleshoot problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Support communications:</b> messages you send to support (including any information you choose to share).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Security/operational logs (limited):</b> timestamps, error codes, and service events (e.g., connection started/ended, server selected).
      These logs are used for stability, abuse prevention, and troubleshooting.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) VPN traffic &amp; content</h2>
  <p>
    DexPN provides VPN functionality using Android’s VPN APIs. The VPN routes your device traffic through an encrypted tunnel.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>We do not collect or store the contents of your VPN traffic</b> (such as visited websites, DNS queries content, message content, or payload data)
    as part of normal service operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may process limited technical connection events (e.g., connection state and errors) to keep the service running reliably and to provide support.
  </p>

  <h2>4) No analytics &amp; no advertising identifier</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>No analytics SDKs:</b> we do not use third-party analytics or tracking SDKs in the App.</li>
    <li><b>No advertising:</b> we do not show ads in the App and do not use the advertising identifier for ad targeting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the VPN service (connectivity, access management, subscription checks).</li>
    <li>Process subscriptions, orders, renewals, and confirm payments.</li>
    <li>Customer support and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>Security and abuse prevention (e.g., preventing fraud, protecting infrastructure).</li>
    <li>Legal compliance where required by applicable law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Legal bases</h2>
  <p>We process personal data when it is necessary to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>perform a contract (provide the service you request),</li>
    <li>pursue legitimate interests (security, service reliability),</li>
    <li>comply with legal obligations,</li>
    <li>or based on your consent (where required by law).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Sharing of data</h2>
  <p>We may share data only as needed to operate the service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Service providers</b> (hosting, infrastructure) under confidentiality obligations.</li>
    <li><b>Payment verification</b> (for example, checking blockchain transactions via public explorers/APIs or providers) only to confirm payment status.</li>
    <li><b>Authorities</b> if required by law or necessary to protect rights, safety, and prevent fraud/abuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>We do not sell your personal data.</b></p>

  <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Subscription/account data: kept while your account is active and as needed for support, billing and dispute handling.</li>
    <li>Security/operational logs: kept for a limited period and then deleted or anonymized.</li>
    <li>Support messages: retained as needed to resolve issues and maintain support history.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
    No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data and investigate incidents.
